Greetings to whoever reviewing my task! Here some inforamtion about app:

1. It's using SqLite as database.
2. Database tables are saving as .json;
3. Loading huge amount of directories will take a lot of time due to bad performance. SORRY!
4. Dynamic load is not saving folders in database or in .json
